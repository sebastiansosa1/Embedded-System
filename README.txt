About the game:

    Have you ever seen that game where a person (or perhaps a machine) throws a plate to the
    air and somebody from the ground shoots a gun directly to the plate? In this game
    you are the one holding the gun.
    You need to smash as many plates as you can.

How to play:

    - The game starts with a welcome message with the name of the game.
    To START the game just push the start button at any time.

    - Once the game started, you are the shooter and your goal is to 
    hit the targets (single point on the display) by moving your gun's scope (cross) with the 
    NAVSWITCH and pressing the trigger (push NAVSWITCH).
    You will have a fixed number of attempts (Set to 10 as default).
    Hurry up! you don't have much time to point the scope to the target and shoot. A new target will
    randomly appear on the display and you will loose an attempt. You
    also loose an attempt if you shoot but the scope is not pointing to the target.
    Be Careful! You don't see the target? Move your scope. The target might be on the scope's blind spot.

    - Once the game is finished, that is once the fixed number of attempts is reached,
    a "Game Over" message will be displayed as long as the scores. The scores are meant to be read as
    a ratio "plates smashed" / "total attempts". So if you, for example, hit 6 targets over 10 attempts,
    the display will show score: 6/10.
    From this screen, you can re-start the game at any time by pressing start button again.


Enjoy the game!
